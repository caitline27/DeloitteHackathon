# Welcome to the Heads in the Cloud team repo!

## Ideas we liked so far:
4, 5, 9

## Option 4 Datasets:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions
2. @Rayan - General thoughts: It is quite difficult to obtain medical dataset due to high regulations. Not a lot of open source data available for the general public. Majority of the open source data in healthcare sector is in epidemiology like this one https://healthdata.gov/search/type/dataset 
3. https://physionet.org/about/database/#overview
4. https://github.com/EpistasisLab/ClinicalDataSources
5. Another team used these: MIMIC III and SyntheticMass

## Justify your idea: 
1)	Pick your idea 
2)	what data sources have you gathered?
- Urls
- Files
3)	What will the app do?
- description
- nice to have: Screen mockups etc.
4)	commercial viability

### Software we might need (please add to this):

- Microsoft Azure Cloud
- Microsoft Powerpoint
- Gimp: https://www.gimp.org/downloads/ (a good open source picture/photo editor)
- The nounproject: https://thenounproject.com/ (a good icon website)
- OBS: https://obsproject.com/download (to record your desktop and make youtube-style videos - useful for demos)
- PyCharm Community Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC (the best Python IDE in the world - yes, much better than Visual Studio Code!)
- IntelliJ Community Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC (the best Java IDE in the world - yes, much better than Eclipse )
- Git SCM https://git-scm.com/download/win (this gives you a good bash shell in linux, and allows you to use git commands)
- Adobe XD (very easy to work with for quick mockups or wireframing) free: https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html
