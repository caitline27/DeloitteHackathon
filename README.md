- PyCharm Community Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC (the best Python IDE in the world - yes, much better than Visual Studio Code!)
- IntelliJ Community Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC (the best Java IDE in the world - yes, much better than Eclipse )
