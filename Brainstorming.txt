Intro:

------------------- Wholesale ----------------|----------------- Retail ------------------------

	Generator		<------			Reseller			<------		End user
				------> i.e. electricity utility companies,------>
						  competetive power providers,
						  and electricity marketers							

Look at figure 1: https://learn.pjm.com/electricity-basics/market-for-electricity.aspx

EU has 2 major markets:
	- Retail market:
		-> The actors are suppliers and customers
		-> Electricity needs to be sold and consumed instantly, hence the demand vs supply is changing constantly
	
	- Wholesale market: 
		-> refers to the buying and selling of power between the generators and suppliers
		-> divided into 4 markets
			- Long-term markets (forward energy markets, forward transmission markets and capacity mechanisms):
				* financial exchanges
				* OTC deals
				-> Negotiated bidding prices are unique to each bidding zone
				-> One country can have multiple bidding zones
				-> cross-zonal trading is when energy is traded between bidding zones
				-> cross-zonal trading requires long-term transmission rights acquired by the JAO 
					(we might ignore cross-zonal trading for this hackathon)
			
			- Spot market
				* day-ahead market (to be ingored in this hackathon)
				* intraday market
				-> prices are decided based on the merit order:
					- buyers bid to buy X MWh for price X
					- Sellers bid to sell X MWh for price X
					- Buying prices are listed on a descending order and buying prices are listed on an ascending order
					- In case (price offer == selling offer) in more than 1 case, the merit order allows the energy units to be sold to the region/city with highest priority
		
			- Balancing market (to be ingored in this hackathon)
				* ensures supply == demand in real time (after the intraday market)
				
			- Transmission re-dispatch markets (to be ingored in this hackathon)
				* needed when trading in a spot market results in potential violation of operational limits:
					- e.g.: thermal limits, voltage ranges
				* occurs within a bidding zone	
				* merged with balancing market in certain EU members

Problem statement: Identify best rerouting power grids during an outage to attain optimal cost and energy footprint
--> We want to maximize the profits of a an electricity retailer while giving the option to reduce energy footprint.

Thought process:
	- Causes of power outage (blackout) : 
		* Transient fault: a fault in powerline; power is restored once the fault is cleared (to be ignored in this hackathon)
		* Brownout: drop in voltage in an electrical power supply (to be ignored in this hackathon)
		* Rolling blackout: demand > supply
			- e.g.: California electricity crisis 2000-2001
			- Î” = |demand - supply| (MWh)
	- During an outage, the energy supplier is forced to participate in the spot market (model 2)
	- In order to minimize the spot market participation, the energy supplier should maximize his long-term market participation (model 1)
		* By accturately modeling his clients demand vs supply

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First model: (reserve problem) maximize energy traded in the long-term market while minimizing the energy traded in spot market.
Assumption: long-term price < spot price (most of the time)

Regulations:
	- merit order: 
		buy(descending)		sell(ascending)
			4				1		The seller makes 3$/unit
			3				2		The seller makes 1$/unit
			2				3		The seller loses 1$/unit
			1				4		The seller loses 3$/unit
	
	- ???:
		buy(descending)		sell(ascending)
			3				3		The energy units are sold to the region/city with highest priority
			3				3		
			3				3		

Second model: 
- in case of over-capacity (supply > demand), predict the upper interval limit of expected selling price in the spot market.
- in case of under-capacity (demand > supply), predict the lower interval limit of expected selling price in the spot market
